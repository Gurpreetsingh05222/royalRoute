            Switzerland is the greatest hiking and walking destination in the
            world. The land is crisscrossed by more than 40,000 miles (65,000
            km) of marked hiking and walking paths, of which over 13,600 miles
            (22,000 km) are mountain trails. Hiking and walking is a way of life
            in Switzerland, where nearly half of the Swiss population hikes
            regularly. Hiking is one of the favorite pastimes in this country
            where over 80% of the Swiss population use the nation’s network of
            footpaths for hiking, running, walking, and other activities. On
            average, Swiss hikers enjoy 20 hikes per year, each averaging about
            three hours. The price of maintaining one kilometer of trail for a
            year is about $800—not cheap—but the Swiss see that as a great
            investment in quality of life and personal well-being. Switzerland's
            superb network of hiking trails is a source of natioal pride and
            civic enjoyment. Alpenwild, with over 20 years of experience guiding
            trips in Switzerland, offers a variety of hiking, trekking, and
            walking tours in the Alps. We know all the best spots in the Alps,
            ensuring a trip of a lifetime.
